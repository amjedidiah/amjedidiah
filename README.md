💡  My journey began in Lagos, Nigeria, where a childhood curiosity about computer games sparked a lifelong love for tech.

🔧  Today, I specialize in full-stack development, wielding the power of JavaScript (React, Next.js, and Node.js) to craft seamless web applications. I also have experience with WordPress for content management, and I'm a Stripe Certified Professional Developer, adept at creating and improving tailored payment solutions.

🎓  I'm dedicated to continuous learning and knowledge sharing. I've mentored 200+ aspiring developers across three continents and have spoken at Google DevFest Enugu in 2022 and 2023.

🤝 I'm open to new and challenging opportunities!

**Let's connect and build something amazing together!**
